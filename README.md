# Project_GUI_circuit_designer
This project is a circuit_designer using GUI, designed to provide a user-friendly interface for creating and simulating circuit designs. The application enables users to import images representing various components, connect them through a graphical drag-and-drop interface, and simulate the connections between components.

Key Features
Image-Based Circuit Design: Allows importing images of circuit components and positioning them on a canvas to represent physical hardware.
Connection Simulation: Supports connecting components with different types of pins (e.g., Vcc, GND) and provides visual feedback, such as changing the LED status based on the connection validity.
Image Movement and Positioning: Enables users to move and arrange components within the canvas, simulating a realistic design environment.
Context Menu Integration: Offers a right-click context menu for making connections, managing component movement, and removing connections.
Predefined Pin Support: Utilizes predefined coordinates for common pins, allowing for accurate simulation and visualization of electrical connections.
Technology Stack
Python: The core programming language used for developing the application.
Tkinter: For the graphical user interface, providing an easy-to-use canvas for component layout and interaction.
PIL (Pillow): For handling image manipulation and rendering within the interface.
Future Enhancements
Additional Component Support: Expand the library of predefined components and their corresponding pin configurations.
Advanced Simulation: Integrate more detailed simulation capabilities to mimic real-world electrical behaviors.
Collaboration Features: Introduce features for sharing designs or working on circuit simulations collaboratively.
